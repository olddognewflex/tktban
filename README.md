# tktban

A terminal **kanban board for tkt**, built with [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea).

tktban renders a tkt board as columns and lets you move, comment on, and create
tickets — all through tkt verbs. It speaks **only the tkt CLI verb contract**
(shell-out, `--json` in, `--json` out): it never imports tkt's internals and never
reads a backend's storage directly. The payoff is that the same TUI works against
*any* backend tkt supports — point it at a markdown board or a Jira config and it
behaves identically, because all it knows are roles, lanes, and the ticket shape.

## Install

```sh
go install github.com/olddognewflex/tktban/cmd/tktban@latest   # or: go build -o tktban ./cmd/tktban
```

Requires Go ≥ 1.26 and `tkt` on your `PATH` (or set `TKT_BIN=/path/to/tkt`).

## The one prerequisite: an `all` query

A board shows *every* ticket, but `tkt list` always needs a named query and ships
none that returns everything. tktban standardizes on a query named **`all`**. Add
this to your project's `.sdlc/config.toml`:

```toml
[queries]
all = 'ORDER BY key ASC'   # empty filter -> tkt returns every ticket
```

Run `tktban doctor` to check your setup:

```sh
tktban doctor              # verifies: tkt on PATH, board.roles readable, `all` query present
```

## Usage

```sh
tktban                     # launch the board (auto-discovers .sdlc/config.toml)
tktban --config path/to/.sdlc/config.toml
```

### Keys

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `r` | Refresh the board |
| `m` / `enter` | Move the selected card to another lane (`tkt transition`) |
| `c` | Comment on the selected card (`tkt comment`) |
| `n` | Create a new ticket (`tkt create`) |
| `o` / `ga` | Focus the herdr pane running this card's agent (inside herdr) |
| `q` | Quit |
| `tab` / arrows | Move focus between columns and cards |

Columns come from `[board.roles]` (in config order); cards are grouped by their
canonical `status_role` and sorted by priority then key. A `⛔N` badge shows
unresolved blocker count. Tickets in an unconfigured lane appear in a trailing
`(unmapped)` column rather than being dropped.

## Run inside herdr

tktban ships a [herdr](https://herdr.dev) plugin manifest (`herdr-plugin.toml`),
so the board opens as a full-screen popup over any herdr workspace.

```sh
herdr plugin install olddognewflex/tktban      # clones and builds bin/tktban (needs Go)

# local development: link the checkout; link does not run the build step
go build -o bin/tktban ./cmd/tktban
herdr plugin link .
```

Bind the action to a key in `~/.config/herdr/config.toml`:

```toml
[[keys.command]]
key = "prefix+t"   # prefix+b is herdr's sidebar toggle
type = "plugin_action"
command = "odnf.tktban.open-board"
```

The key opens the board and, pressed again, closes it (so does `q`). herdr
allows one popup at a time; if another plugin's popup is open, the key leaves it
alone. Toggling needs `python3` on herdr's PATH; without it the key only opens. The board reads the tkt config found from the focused pane's
directory, falling back to the workspace root, so each project shows its own
board.

Under herdr the pane runs `tktban --herdr`, which:

- finds `.sdlc/config.toml` from the herdr context when `--config` is not given;
- keeps UI settings in the plugin state dir
  (`~/.local/state/herdr/plugins/odnf.tktban/settings.toml`), copied once from
  your standalone settings so the theme carries over. If that path is a
  symlink it is ignored and the standalone settings file is used instead;
- holds a lock on `board.lock` in the same dir while running, which is how the
  launcher knows the open popup is the board.

Outside herdr the flag does nothing. For publishing, tag the GitHub repo with
the `herdr-plugin` topic so it shows in the herdr plugin marketplace.
[docs/herdr-events.md](docs/herdr-events.md) records which herdr events the
live status below and future hooks can use.

### Live agent badges

Inside herdr (any pane, with or without `--herdr`) the board polls herdr's
socket every 500 ms and badges each card whose ticket has an agent running,
with no refresh key needed. The subtitle shows `herdr live` while this is on.

| Badge | Meaning | Source |
|-------|---------|--------|
| ⚙ | agent working | herdr (or frontmatter `processing` when live is off) |
| 🙋 | agent waiting on you: a permission prompt or question | herdr |
| ⏳ | waiting | frontmatter `agent_status` |
| 🚫 | blocked | frontmatter `agent_status` |
| ✓ | done | frontmatter `agent_status` |

herdr `idle` and `done` show no badge. While live is on, herdr's 🙋 / ⚙ win
over the ticket's frontmatter; otherwise the frontmatter badge shows, except
`processing`, which is hidden because herdr says no agent is working (a killed
pane clears its badge on the next poll even though the file still says
`processing`). Outside herdr, with `--no-herdr-live`, or while herdr is not
answering, badges come from frontmatter alone, exactly as without herdr. If
herdr speaks an unsupported socket protocol, live status stays off for the
run. Any other failure (herdr not answering at startup, or 3 failed polls
later) shows one warning, retries every 2 s, and goes live again on its own
once herdr is back.

Panes are matched to tickets by branch: the board reads the git branch checked
out in each agent pane's directory (linked worktrees included) and takes the
ticket key from it, following the `.sdlc` branch convention
`feature/{key-lower}-{slug}` or `hotfix/{key-lower}-{slug}`, e.g.
`feature/tkb-22-live-herdr-status` → `TKB-22`. A branch naming several keys
(`revert-45-feature/tkb-22-x`) badges each of them. Agents on a branch with
no key are ignored. When several agent panes work one ticket, 🙋 beats ⚙.
The branch comes from the `.git/HEAD` file; only repos using reftable ref
storage, where that file is a stub, run `git symbolic-ref` instead.

### Jump between a card and its agent pane

Two-way navigation, so the board and the agent working a ticket are one key
apart.

**Card → pane.** With the board open, `o` (or `ga`, for hands that reach for a
vim `g` prefix) focuses the herdr pane running the selected card's agent — its
workspace, tab and pane, in one `pane.focus`. When the board is herdr's popup
it closes on the way, leaving you in the agent pane; a board running in a
plain herdr pane stays open and just moves focus. When a ticket has several
agent panes, the one herdr already has focused wins, otherwise the most urgent
(🙋 over ⚙ over quiet).

Nothing is silent. The key says `No agent pane for TKB-23` when no agent is on
that ticket, `Live agent status is off` outside herdr (or with
`--no-herdr-live`), `herdr live status unavailable` while herdr is not
answering, and `Agent pane for TKB-23 is gone` when the pane closed between the
last poll and the keypress — in which case the board stays open.

**Pane → card.** Pressing the `prefix+t` board key *inside* an agent pane opens
the board with that pane's ticket already selected: the action runs with the
invoking pane's directory, and the board takes the key from the branch checked
out there. A ticket that is real but sits in a column you have hidden says so
and names `X` (show all columns); one that is not on the board says that
instead.

Standalone, the same thing is a flag:

```sh
tktban --select TKB-23           # open the board with TKB-23 selected
tktban --select-from-cwd         # ...with whatever this branch's ticket is
```

`--select` wins over `--select-from-cwd`. The selection is applied once, on the
first load, so a later auto-refresh never drags you back to it.

## How it talks to tkt

`internal/tkt/tkt.go` is the entire coupling surface — a thin subprocess wrapper:

| tktban call | tkt verb |
|-------------|----------|
| read columns | `tkt cfg board.roles --json` |
| read tickets | `tkt list --query all --json` |
| move | `tkt transition KEY ROLE` |
| comment | `tkt comment KEY BODY` |
| create | `tkt create --type T --summary S [...] --json` |

Config is passed via the `TKT_CONFIG` env var (tkt's global `--config` placed
*before* a verb is clobbered by an argparse quirk; the env var is reliable for
every verb).

## Development

```sh
go build ./...
go test ./...
```

Tests cover the wrapper (subprocess faked via an injected runner), the board model
(pure grouping/sort), settings persistence, and the UI model/modals (rendered to
strings and asserted).
